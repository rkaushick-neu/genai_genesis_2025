🌟 Inspiration
Mintality was born from a simple observation: traditional financial apps focus on what we spend, but rarely address why we spend. As a team, we noticed that our own spending patterns fluctuated with our emotional states — stress-induced takeout orders, anxiety-driven online shopping, and celebratory splurges after good news.

Studies show that Americans spend an estimated $143 billion annually on emotional purchases, yet most financial tools treat money management as a purely rational activity, ignoring the powerful emotional factors that drive our financial decisions.

🤖 Built With
